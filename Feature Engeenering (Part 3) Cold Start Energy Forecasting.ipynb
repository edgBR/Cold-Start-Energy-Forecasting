    "Before we start, I will copy some idea that we got in previous stages :\n",
    "#### Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here we have 1383 building, 758 in training data and the rest in test data.\n",
    "- We have 276923 training data, and 81827 test data\n",
    "- We have many missing value in temperature\n",
    "- etc\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the data train each building is provided with the same number of sample trainings, namely samples in units of hours in 28 days. while in the data test, the number of data samples for each building varies, there are 4 days, 12 days, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detail you can check direcly to the notebook https://github.com/fauzantaufik/Cold-Start-Energy-Forecasting/blob/master/EXPLOLATORY%20DATA%20TO%20DEFINE%20PROBLEM%20DEEPLY.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "- seen that consumption from year to year is increasing, so maybe years will be a good feature to be the input in our model\n",
    "- The month will also be a good feature. there is a seasonal pattern from month to month.\n",
    "- There is some noise in data\n",
    "- Consumption nearly uniform from hour to hour, but some date have pattern in consomption by hour to hour\n",
    "- There is some correlation bettwen temperature/hour and consumption/hour\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"One of the challenges is in the way we fill in the missing values. because many buildings have a temperature value that is lost up to 100%. meaning that for one year the temperature inside the building is unknown!!.\n",
    "\n",
    "we cannot fill this missing value with linear interpolation, even if it has to be non-linear we will have difficulty determining the degree of non-linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because all series IDs have the same pattern regarding the temperature value. then it's have to be good if we try to build a model that will predict the temperature value. this is a gonna be like other project though, but it's worth it since we have missinig value almost 50% in temperature\"\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "=======================================\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"For electricity consumption in each building, it seems that each building has a different level of electricity consumption. may depend on the type of building. there are buildings that always need electricity every time. there are also buildings that only require electricity when at certain times such as working hours and then a little consumption at night.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Talk about electricity consumption : \n",
    "- There is a changes in consumption pattern over year. but it's not abvious the rule of pattern. and I dont know is it significant or not. but it's in my hipotesis.\n",
    "- There is no really abvious pattern of electricity consumption over month and day of month.\n",
    "- There is a pattern in the name of day, the consumpton is low in holiday (saturday and sunday) than in work days.\n",
    "- There is a pattern in series of hours, which is the high consumption at work time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to talk about Temperature due to we wanna build predictive model for temperature because of the need of fill in the missing value :\n",
    "- The temperature seem to be increase over year.\n",
    "- The temperature seem to be have seasonal pattern in series of month.\n",
    "- The temperature seem to be constant in the day of month and in the day of week.\n",
    "- Of course, the temperature is higher in the daytime hours\n",
    "\n",
    "- the variance in consumption vs. lag increases with further lag\n",
    "- temperature vs temperature lag-k seem have to be same \n",
    "\n",
    "One more problem is we have no sample for electricity consumption and temperature in 2012.\n",
    "\n",
